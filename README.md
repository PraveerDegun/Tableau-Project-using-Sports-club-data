# Tableau Dashboard: Membership Fee & Invoice Analysis

## Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive view of unpaid invoices segmented by age group and team. It also includes an interactive What-If fee model that allows users to explore how changes in membership fees impact overall revenue. The dashboard combines key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total income, renewal rate, and unpaid invoices, and enables filtering to analyze data by team or age group.
